## Take home project

This app is my solution for a Take-home project - problem where you have three views with a shared persistent state.

Two of the views have inputs to enter values and the third view shows the result for the last edited view.

The app is done with iOS and Xcode 11. Programming is done in Swift 5.1.

I have implemented many language and platform features but at the same time, I kept the architecture simple and readable so that the solution can be easily be extended or be modified for new needs.

### Some of the features

#### ðŸ‘“ Dynamic Fonts

#### ðŸŒ‘ Dark mode support

#### ðŸ“±iPad and iPhone support

#### ðŸ“ˆ Unit Tests

#### ðŸ“‰ UI Tests

_Not a single codebase is perfect so I would love to hear any feedback!_
